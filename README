You should be able to directly build and run our app.
To run our app properly, you have to use a real iphone, instead of a simulator, so you would need to edit the bundle identifier to run on your phone.
Our app don't run on simulators because they don't have camera and motion device.

To use our app, you can simply use the GPS measure, to measure the distance between two points.
You can drop two pins by holding on map to measure the distance between them.
You can also use camera measure with a ruler. 
Step 1: Press Observe Measure, put the phone at left end of the ruler and point the crosshair at the target and take a photo.
Step 2: Move the phone right along the ruler, and type in the distance moved on the ruler.
Step 3: Take another photo while pointing the crosshair at the target.
Step 4: Get result.
